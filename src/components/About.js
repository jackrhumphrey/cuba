        <p>About your host</p>
        <p>
          I am a self confessed foodie and I am passionate about dining culture
          in Wellington. As a local I know all the neighborhood favourites and
          hidden gems. I am a Maitre'D in a restaurant and in my spare time I
          write recipes for a magazine column. Food is more than a hobby for me,
          it is my life, and I want to share it with visitors by taking them to
          extraordinary restaurants and experiencing our local cuisine and food
          culture.
        </p>
        <p>What we’ll do</p>
        <p>
          We will begin with a complimentary glass of wine to get acquainted and
          to hear a little history of the area. We will visit three exceptional
          restaurants around the most diverse area of Wellington - Cuba Street.
          Ranging from quirky to fancy, we will traverse the area, taking in
          sights and immersing ourselves in the local foodie culture. Wellington
          is the foodie capital of the country, with abundant restaurants and
          bars, but it takes a local to know the special gems of the city. All
          restaurants are within a 2 or 3 minute walk from one another.
        </p>
        <p>What else you should know</p>
        <p>
          You will need to allocate a approx 3 hours for the tour. We will be
          within walking distance of many hotels in the Cuba Street and central
          city, but transport will need to be organised to get here.
